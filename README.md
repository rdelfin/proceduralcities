# proceduralcities
The final project for CS 354

To compile this code:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
```

To run the binary (from the project root directory):

```
cd build/bin
./cities
```

The projects must be run from either `build/bin`, or from the project root 
directory to ensure the `resources` folder is available in the present
working directory.
